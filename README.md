## Summary
In this project I was looking for the most likely people to have survived the Titanic Disaster. In my analysis I found that women, young passengers and upper class passengers are more likely to have survived.

## Design
I have majorly used bar charts to visualize. For my use case bar chart mostly sufficed. For the final story I have first visualized passengers by gender, and then by class. And finally I visualized Survival Rate with gender and class.
## Feedback
I referred my friends and family for review. They made good suggestions as listed below:
1.	Replace 0,1 in Survive column with “Died”, and “Survived”. This made it easy for them to understand the visualization.
2.	Replace Female and Male in Sex column with F, and M. They are both clear enough to suggest which gender the curve belongs to. Latter takes much less space than the former.
3.	Replace count with percentages, so that the viewer can easily visualize the proportions instead of checking all the numbers to get an intuition about the actual proportions.
4.	Use one legend for the entire dashboard.
